This repository contains Eclipse WikiText support for the [Atlassian Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) Wiki. It was originally intended to be contributed to the [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) [Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn) project. However integration with commercial products does not fit well within the [Mylyn charter](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Charter) so the code appears here instead. The related discussion can be found in [Eclipse bug 335280](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=335280).
