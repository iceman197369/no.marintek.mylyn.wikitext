This repository contains Ant tasks for culling an [Atlassian Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/) Wiki and producing Eclipse Help, EPUB or PDF documents. These tasks are based on the [Mylyn Docs](http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php?id=mylyn.docs) Wikitext *mediawiki-to-eclipse-help* task and share much of the same syntax:

* *confluence-to-eclipse-help* - Produces Eclipse Help.
* *confluence-to-pdf* - Produces a PDF file.
* *confluence-to-epub* - Produces an EPUB file.

The EPUB task is a little special. It also supports all features of the Mylyn Docs EPUB task. The syntax is also the same for the EPUB related parts.

Note that version 1.1.0 of Mylyn Docs EPUB is required. This is currently only available in [weekly builds](http://download.eclipse.org/mylyn/snapshots/weekly/). The most recent release (with Eclipse Juno) is 1.0.0.
