This repository contains certain enhancements to the [Atlassian Confluence](http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/)
support in Mylyn WikiText. It was originally intended to be contributed to the 
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org) [Mylyn](http://www.eclipse.org/mylyn) project
but this could not be done due to the fact that integration with commercial 
products does not fit well within the [Mylyn charter](http://wiki.eclipse.org/Mylyn/Charter).
The related discussion can be found in [Eclipse bug 335280](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=335280).
